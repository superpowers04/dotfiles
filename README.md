# Supers dotfiles
A bunch of random config stuff and such.<br>
Note that a lot of the stuff here is NOT well designed or well documented and is ABSOLUTELY bodged together and will probably not immediately work on anything you throw it onto.<br>
I use both Sway and CwC as CwC isn't finished and is missing support for certain things like drawing tablets. I use arch so I have no idea what packages to use on Debian, Fedora, etc<br><br>
If you need help with anything, DM me on Discord or something

## Used packages:

### Global
- swaync
- waybar
- luajit
- lua-lgi (Specifically installed using `luarocks install lgi --lua-version=5.1`. Used for any GTK stuff like appmenuGtk.lua)

### Sway
- aur/swaysome-git
- 

### CwC
